# File Organizer Scripts

## Organization Script (`organization.py`)

The Organization Script is a Python script that helps to organize files and folders on your computer. It takes two folders, Desktop and Downloads, and moves their contents to an "Archive" folder with the current date. The script skips alias files and folders, and renames files with the same name by adding a "_1" suffix. The script also logs its progress and any errors that occur during the organization process.

## Clean Script (`clean.py`)

The Clean Script is a Python script that cleans up empty folders in the "Archive" folders of your Desktop and Downloads folders. It walks through the folder tree, checks for empty folders, and moves them to the trash. The script logs its progress and any errors that occur during the cleaning process.

Together, these two scripts help to keep your computer organized and clutter-free by moving files and folders to an "Archive" folder and removing empty folders.
